# Password Manager

Can you relate to this situation?

> Your password should be long 🐍
> 
> Your password should include a huge characterset 💬
>
> Your password should be complex 🎇
>
> You should not reuse your passwords 🔁
> 
> Your password should take the hobbits to Isengard 💍
> 
> AND you should not write your password down anywhere 🧠

How could anyone be able to handle that?!<br>
This is why you need a **Password Manager** where you can securely store your passwords in an encrypted format.

## How it works
You can find further documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/CUMGroup/PWManager/wiki) tab.

## Envrionment Setup
You will need a version of [**.NET 7**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed on your computer.

After cloning the repository run the `build.sh` (Linux) or the `build.bat` (Windows) script. You will find your executable in `./PWManager.CLI/bin/Release/net7.0/`

(To run via the dotnet cli you can run `dotnet run` in the `./PWManager.CLI/` directory)
